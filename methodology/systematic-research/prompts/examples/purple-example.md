## Usage as Template

To research another mattress using this same approach:

### 1. Copy Research Parameters
```
Brand: [NEW_BRAND]
Collection: [NEW_COLLECTION]
Retailer Variant: [NEW_VARIANT] 
Size: Queen
```

### 2. Use Same Prompts
- Research agent prompt (with new parameters)
- Validation agent prompt (with new JSON)

### 3. Expect Similar Results
- 15-minute research execution
- Comprehensive evidence-backed specification
- Schema-compliant JSON output
- Customer-deployment ready quality

This example proves the systematic approach can replicate your manual research quality while dramatically reducing time and effort.
